## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## How to complete the submission

Copy over from the instruction code (or paraphrase - think of this as 
practice commenting your code) into the html text chunks. Then, in the R
chunks, write in the code you use to complete each step. Add in additional
R chunks using the insert button above.

And be sure to include the numbers as in the instructions. So the first
step would start of looking like this (you'll fill in the R code below).

```{r}

```

## 1
