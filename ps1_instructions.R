# EBIO 338/538 Problem Set 1

#1 Import the problem set data file on gibbon foods and name the object food

#2 What are the dimensions of the data?

#3 What are the variable names?

#4 What type of object is food and what class are the variables within it?

#5 What is the mean fruiting frequency?

#6 What is the mean stem density?

#7 Extract all observations with one or more use into an object named eaten

#8 What percent of genera were eaten by gibbons?

#9 Add a new column to eaten called Form_Crop that contains information on form and cropsize separated by an underscore "_"

#10 Display the first 5 lines of eaten.

#11 How many unique combinations of FormCrop in eaten are there?

#12 In the object eaten, convert Form "Tree" to "T" and "Vine" to "V"

#13 Is the updated Form in eaten a factor? If so, make it a character string. If not, make it a factor.

#14 Extract all observations from object food that have a crop size of II. Call the object CSII.

#15 Create a list called mylist that contains the objects food, eaten, FormCrop, CSII, and the letter w. 

#16 Name each element in mylist using the input object names

#17 Extract the 4th element of the 3rd element in mylist using two different ways

#18 Extract the observations of food that have DBH values greater than 10 but less than 55. How many observations meet these criteria?

#19 Generate a TRUE/FALSE vector indicating which rows in object food have the value "Tree" for Form.

#20 Using the object food, calculate total basal area, which is the product of stem density and DBH
